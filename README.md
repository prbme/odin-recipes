# odin-recipes
This is my first project with TOP (The Odin Project). It is a simple HTML recipes site. 
In this project I have used the following:
- how to create an index.html file. All sites must have an index.html
- creating and linking to other .html files. These files my must also follow .html boilerplate.
- the use of absolute (to other sites) and relative (within a site) links
- basic use of html page formatting heading and paragraph tags.
- Use of images witt the alt descriptions for accessibility. 
- Using git and git hub. git clone, git add, git commit and git push.
